# Implementation

- Create a circle on the screen and align the circle to centre of screen in a way that even if screen is resized, circle is always kept in the centre. If user hovers on the circle, the circle should be moved smoothly 100px to top.    

- Create a input type and a progress bar. Initially the progress bar shouldn't be filled. Take the value from input bar and accordingly fill the progress bar in percentage. (You can assume that values will be in range 0-100)
- Given a parent and child div (the dimensions of both parent and child are not pre-determined). What are various ways in which child can be aligned to centre of div. (Additional: Write the code such that it is supported in IE8) [Solution in JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/emxr3htj/)   

- Given 3 divs on screen with each have some colour to them (e.g. Red, Green, Blue). Write a code so that when user clicks on the divs, the color for the current and previously clicked div is swapped [Solution in JSBin](https://jsbin.com/yanomizuwo/2/edit?html,js,console,output)
